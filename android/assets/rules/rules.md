# How To Play

At the start of the game, each player arranges their 40 pieces in a 4x10 configuration at their side of the field. By tapping on a piece and then on an orange highlight, a piece can be placed and moved on the playing field. A double tap removes the piece from the playing field and places it back at the start position.
